\section{Layout}

An important aspect of user interfaces is that they must be visually impressive. This keeps the user interested in the product, and helps new users want to learn how to operate the device. The work done in the windowing toolkit allowed a much more visually impressive layout to be developed. This was achieved through the use of transparencies in order to overlay different elements on top of each other.

\subsection{Background}

As the device does not have enough power to dynamically render any sort of complex images or motions, a pre-rendered static background was used. This background was designed on another pc, and converted for use on the embedded system. It consists of two main regions. The first area is the main display region. This section is the largest of the space and exists so the current data being displayed can be laid over it. The second region is the navigation bar region. This area is at the bottom of the image, it uses a more uniform texture in order to contrast the main data display area above it. The background itself is rendered in black and white. The black and white styling allows important information to contrast against it easily. This helps highlight the information and user interface actions present to the user, and avoids a simple single-colour background on the user interface.

\subsection{Navigation Model}

Figure \ref{uinavigation} shows the basic routes throughout the user interface. This model is a generic tree, that can have as many leafs as possible. When the user wishes to navigate to a new panel, a pointer to that new panel is required. Thus as-long as the panel knows of the panel it wishes to transition to, any panel can be made active from any other panel. This allows the nested elements, such as syslog and status to navigate to any of the higher level panels easily as-well. These routes are not shown on the diagram, as there would be too many pathways to follow. If a panel returns a NULL pointer, the system will navigate to the App Panel to avoid a crash. This also provides handy functionality for traversing back to the top-most panel in the tree, as any leaf panel can request to transition to NULL and the App Panel will be displayed.
