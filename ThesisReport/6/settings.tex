\section{Settings}

The previous features have all discussed elements of the interface that are useful to any general driver. These are features that are useful while operating the vehicle. There also exists another user that has a different set of requirements to fulfill. This user is the maintainer of the car. This user will need access to various aspects for debugging and development purposes, including the ability to easily examine and transfer the internal logs of the system. In order to help simplify the navigation of the program, these elements are located in the settings screen. A screen-shot of the settings screen is shown in figure \ref{options}.
