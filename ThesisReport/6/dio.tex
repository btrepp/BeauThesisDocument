\section{Digital Inputs}
\label{sec:diopanel}
Described in section \ref{sec:arduino} was a hardware system able to interface with digital inputs. The purpose of this panel is to display those inputs to the operator. This display is shown in figure \ref{dio}. It uses digit elements to display the two connected voltages, and the two calculated frequencies. It also uses a boolean triggered display element to display the status of 8 individual digital inputs. This display shows the raw data from the input board, enabling the values being transmitted to be examined and analyzed in real-time.
