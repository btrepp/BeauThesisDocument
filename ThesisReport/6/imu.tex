\section{Interial Measurement Unit Display Panel}

Developed in section \ref{sec:imu} was a system that read accelerometer data from a serial connection. This data is displayed on the device via the IMU display panel. This panel is shown in figure \ref{imu}. As the data in \ref{sec:imu} is not currently calibrated, this panel outputs the raw data for display on the screen. The main purpose of this is to verify that the module is functioning correctly, and to developed a template for future work with displaying and interpreting this data. This panel displays the acceleration on the x, y and z axis and also shows the pitch roll and yaw of the IMU device.
