Electric vehicles are advantageous over traditional ICE vehicles as they operate with zero emissions. These vehicles have no exhaust, so therefore have no emissions. While this does not make them completely pollutant free, it does help limit and control the emissions being produced by the act of transport. It is important to remember when discussing electric vehicles that the components must be manufactured using industrial processes and the act of generation electricty. This does not making them truly carbon neutral, but helps limit the sources of pollution. It is much more easier to manage the pollution produced from one power plant, than that from thousands upon millions of vehicles.
